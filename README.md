## Teamwork
We broke down the parts of the project into managable sub assignments for each team member.
- Jordan Harvey created the skeleton code of the program. 
- All worked on bugfixing and making their own implementations, but found that the ideal submission was Camarena Matthew's.
- README.md done by Jens Bernardino/Patrick Myers
- Documentation done by Jens Bernardino/Patrick Myers 
- Testing done as a team for different environments MacOSX, and Ubuntu.
